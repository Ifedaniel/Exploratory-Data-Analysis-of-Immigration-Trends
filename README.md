# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Immigration-Trends
This study does an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of immigration data, providing a deep inquiry into migration trends seen over several years

I.	INTRODUCTION 
---
Employee attrition is a significant concern for businesses, Why do people move to the United Kingdom? Why do people leave the United Kingdom? Do people leave the United Kingdom? These are questions we are going to uncover in this study, as net migration (the difference between immigration and emigration) is a huge topic in the United Kingdom (UK) right now. Net migration is an important data point to UK policymakers, as this data is believed to affect the UK in terms of economic growth social, and cultural ways positively and negatively.

II.	DATA DESCRIPTION
----
The dataset used in this analysis contains extensive annual records of migration, including immigration, emigration, and net migration. It also classifies migration motivations, such as employment, study, and others. The data ranges from 1991 to 2022, providing a long-term view on migration trends. This comprehensive dataset was derived from the ONS Migration Statistics Quarterly Report, assuring excellent data integrity and dependability.

III.	METHODOLOGY
---
To dive into the complexities of migration data, this study employs a comprehensive data analysis approach, especially Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Our analytical method was multidimensional, covering Descriptive Analysis, Trend Analysis, Migration Reason Analysis, and Comparative Immigration and Emigration Analysis.
During the Descriptive Analysis phase, essential statistical metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range were used to get basic insights into the dataset.

IV.	RESULT
---
Across the bulk of the years studied, the comparative analysis of immigration and emigration rates consistently revealed a larger frequency of immigration as opposed to emigration.
This trend highlights the UK's desirability as a destination for immigrants, with a greater number of individuals entering the country than departing. The current trend of increased immigration rates leads to the continuing growth in net migration data, reflecting the United Kingdom's position as a net recipient of migrants.

V.	DISCUSSION
---
The research examined the intricacies and dynamic nature of migration trends in depth. It was shown that migration rates fluctuate, perhaps driven by a variety of variables such as economic situations, which encourage persons to travel to the UK in search of work opportunities. Furthermore, governmental policies, notably those affecting study regulations in the United Kingdom, emerged as key predictors of migration. These elements frequently create possibilities that draw people to the UK. This study sheds more insight on the complicated interplay of many components of migration, emphasising the diverse nature of migration events.

VI.	CONCLUSION
---
This exploratory data study provides significant insights into UK immigration trends, expanding our understanding of migration dynamics. The findings are crucial for UK policymakers and scholars because they provide a solid, data-driven foundation for informed decision-making and additional scholarly investigations into migration. Future research might improve on this work by using more extensive data, encompassing a larger variety of factors, and using predictive modelling approaches, such as the ARIMA model, to forecast future migration trends.
